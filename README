This program acts as a daemon, which grabs Ctrl+Shift+U key combination
and allows to enter Unicode character by typing its hexadecimal code.

WARNING: the daemon grabs keyboard when Ctrl+Shift+U is pressed, so if
it appears to have some bug in handling the character code entry, your
keyboard might remain unusable until you kill the daemon. In such a case
try first pressing Esc key — chances are the daemon will release the grab.

For compilation you'll need X11 development files (libx11-dev on Ubuntu)
and libxdo development files (libxdo-dev on Ubuntu).

To compile, just run `make` in the source directory. This will give you
`ucode` binary, which you can install by issuing `make install`.

Default installation location is `/usr/bin/`. You can change it by
using `make DESTDIR=/my/custom/path install`.

After this, running ucode at X startup would let you now enter Unicode
characters in any application by using this sequence:

1. Press Ctrl
2. Press Shift
3. Type the hexadecimal code, e.g. 3b4 for Greek delta δ
4. Release Ctrl and Shift

The code entry mode will remain active until both Shift and Ctrl are
released.
